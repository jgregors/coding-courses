The best way to learn is by doing and we will start doing straight away by creating and executing
our first lines of javascript code in a browser console.

Open google chrome and then click F12. You will see a window appear. Click on the console tab
and then click the "clear console log" icon to clear anything already there. This is a javascript 
console and it is a tool for coders to use to test small pieces of javascript. Let's start by 
learning about numbers and then learning how we can do arithmetic with javascript.

Numbers

A number is a javascript datatype. All programming languages have different types that we can perform 
operations upon. You will soon encounter other datatypes but for now we will get familiar with numbers 
and some of the operations we can perform using them.

5 + 10
15

Numbers in javascript can be shown as integers (whole numbers) or with decimals and can be positive or 
negative. Just like in maths class if we want to add two numbers together we have to apply an "operator"
to them, in this case, the "addition" operator. For addition and subtraction, 
these operators look exactly as they do when we use them with paper and pencil. And as you would expect, if
we want to add more than 2 numbers, we would type:

5 + 10 + 15 

to get the answer.

We can see with subtraction that we can also get negative numbers:

5 - 10

Next we have the mulitplication operator:

5 * 10

And the division operator

5 / 10

which both look similar to the mulitplication and division operators we learnt at school and operate
in the same way, resepctively. Notice that the division operation produced a decimal number as an answer.

Lets move on.
