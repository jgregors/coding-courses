Variables are an important concept in programming languages that might seem a little abstract at
first but are not all that hard to understand once you start using them. Just like in algebra 
class at school, programming languages can use symbols to represent numbers. It may help to 
think of the symbol as a box that you are placing a number inside. To create a variable, we need to 
declare it to the program by using "var".

var x

You will see the word "undefined". Every time you enter something into the console, it tries to evaluate
what you have input and then give you an answer. In this case, there is no answer so it returns "undefined".
This will make more sense soon. To place a number inside the variable, we "assign" the number to the 
variable with the assignment operator which is "=". This is not the same as the equals sign we use in 
math class which will be covered when we talk about "comparison".

x = 5

You will see that it returns "5". The console knows what is inside the box and returns its
contents. Type "x" again and press enter and you will see the number is still there. The console has
remembered the variable we have declared. Notice how we didn't use "var" when we assigned the value 5
to x? We should always declare a variable once using "var" as it is possible to declare a variable without
it, but this is considered bad practice (more on that later).

Let's declare another variable, y, and assign the value 10 to it:

var y = 10

This is how you declare and assign a variable in one statement. Each line we type and enter is known as a 
statement and in turn, statements make up programs. Now let's create anther statement to assign to a new
variable, called "result":

var result = x + y

If you type

result

you will see the answer of 15. Now your program can refer to this variable and even change it from any point
onwards:

result = result + 10;

By typing result, you will now see that it equals 25. This is saying, take the result, add 10 to it and then 
assign this new result to the result variable. And just to be smart, lets jump forward a little and
use another type of assignment operator that makes the above statement a little shorter:

result += 10;

This is equivalent to "result = result + 10" but is more succinct. There are also other assignment operators
for subtraction, mulitplication and division.

We have covered a lot here and the power of variables may not yet be obvious to you but you will soon get to 
see what we can achieve when we start writing our own full programs.
