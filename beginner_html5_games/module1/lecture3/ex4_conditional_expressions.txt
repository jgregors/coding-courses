We will continue with our surly calculator by making it slighty surlier. We want to add 
an intitial question to the program so that the user can confirm or quit the program
before any calculations take place.

We will use a confirm popup box to ask this question and to also return a boolean 
value representing whether the user clicked OK or Cancel, namely true and false respectively.

But then we need to make a decision. If the user clicks OK, the program will continue on to 
the calculation that we coded before.
If the user clicks Cancel, the surly calculator will display a slightly angry response and
then exit. How can we accompolish this? the answer is to use a conditional operator. In this
case an if/else statement which looks like this:

if(condition) {
	// do something here
} 
else {
	// do something here
}

This code should be self-explanatory: if the condition is true, do what is between the curly braces.
Otherwise, do what is between the other curly braces. Simple. We will be using if and else here, 
but you can also use if by itself:

if(condition) {
	// do something when true
}

You could also use an if with an if/else like so:

if(condition) {
	// do something
}
else if(condition) {
	// do something else
}
else {
	// do something else 
}

and you get have any variation on this that you would like.

Back to our calculator. The final code looks like this:

	<script>

      var proceed = confirm("You want me to calculate something?")

      if(proceed) {
        var first = prompt("Then give me a number, knucklehead.\n\n");

        var second = prompt("And another. Make it snappy.\n\n");

        var operator = prompt("Now. Do you want me to add (+), _
                              subtract (-), multiply (*) or divide (/)?");

        var answer = eval(first + operator +second);

        alert("Your answer is " + answer + ". How smart am I?");  
      }
      else {
        alert("Then stop wasting my time.");
      }

  	</script>

  Here we store the boolean result of the confirmation in a variable then pass it to
  the if statement. If the variable contains true, the code that produces the calculation
  will execute. If the variable contains false, an alert telling the user to "stop wasting 
  time" will pop up and the program will exit.

  // run through the code.
