Strings
=======

Another basic data type that is extremely common in programs is the string. A string is used
to represent a series of characters. In javascript, a string is any text inside single or double
quotes:

"hello" or 'hello'

Just like numbers we can store strings (and, for that matter, any other javascript type) in variables:

var name = "Michael Jordan"

Notice that whitespace (the space between words including newlines and tabs) is part of the string.
And just like numbers, we can use the "+" symbol to perform an operation on strings. This time, it is 
for concatenation (joining several strings together into one) as opposed to addition although this may
feel inherently similar to addition, anyway.

var result = "john" + "son";

Unlike with numbers, the -, * and / symbols do not really work with strings and if you use them with
strings the result is somewhat strange to the untrained eye:

"one" - "two"
NaN

NaN stands for "Not a Number". Have a think about what may be happening here. There is a lot to cover 
with strings but this question and others will be answered in coming lectures.


Another simple datatype which you will be using in every program that you write is the seemingly
strangely-named boolean. Booleans (or bools) are named after the mathematician, George Boole, who 
created the field of mathematical logic that has since been named after him. He even has a crater on the moon 
named after him so don't underestimate his contribution to the world: computing and by extension
much of the modern world is based on his work.

A boolean represents true or false in computer programs:

var isReady = true
isReady = false

The + symbol is also used on booleans

true + true
2

true + false
1

false + false
0

Understanding the results of applying + to booleans is a little less intuitive. Computers are 
built upon base 2 numbers (also known as binary digits or bits) which literally means 0s and 1s.
In javascript, booleans are converted to 0s and 1s when used with the + operator, with false equal 
to 0 and true equal to 1 repsectively; Hence true + true will be converted to 1 + 1 which will 
evaluate to 2.
