So far we have been using the browser console to experiment with javascript. This is not
the only way javascript is ran and is also not the most common. Javascript was developed 
to manipulate html documents on websites to add more functionality to them. This course 
concentrates on coding games in javascript and not on web development so there will be no
in-depth explanation of html manipulation but I will give a brief, high level overview here.

As seen in the previous section, it is easy to create a simple web page using only html and
css. But there is a problem. We can really only read text from pages or link to other pages.
How can we do all the fun stuff like add items to shoppings carts, send & delete emails or 
tweet what we had for breakfast? Javascript gives us the tools to
do all of this and more. In the console, although we could execute as many statements as we
wanted, it is a pain to have to type large programs into the console. By adding javascript to
an html file we can write and execute large programs simply by loading 
them into a browser. To add javascript to an html document, we need to add a script 
element to the body of the html:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Javascript</title>
    </head>
  	<body>
  		<script></script>
  	</body>
</html>

By adding this, we can now write some javascript code in the html document and begin to 
manipulate its contents! Here's an example to show you want we can accompolish with 
javascript but don't worry if you don't understand the code right now. We will create a
heading and a button underneath it. When the button is clicked, the heading will be changed.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Javascript</title>
    </head>
  	<body>
      <h1 id="heading">With Power Comes Great Responsibility</h1>
  		<script>
        document.addEventListener("click", function() {
          document.getElementById("heading").innerHTML = "Francois-Marie Arouet (aka Voltaire)";
          });
  		</script>
  	</body>
</html>

Here, we have an h1 element which we have given an id attribute set to "heading" and
with text "With Power Comes Great Responsibility".
In the script element, we add an eventlistener to the document. Events are things that 
happen while the page is running like a user clicking the mouse or pressing a key. Here
we listen for any click event which occurs on the document and then when it occurs we
want to get the element identified by the id "heading" and set its html to the name
Francoise-Marie Arouet, the owner of the previously showing quote.
