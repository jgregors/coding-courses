  		<h1>First Webpage</h1>

  		<p>HTML itself was not designed to define how a document should look.
  			That is the job of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). By allowing styles
  			to be separated from the content we can remove a lot of
  			duplication and redundancy in the HTML because we only have to make
  			changes in the one place.</p>
  		<p>We get consistency in styling across elements.</p>
  		<p id="special">We can individually select an element with #</p>
  		<p class="white-text">We can even create out own styles to apply to elements.
  			These are known as classes.</p>
