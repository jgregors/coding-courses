Exercises:

-	write a game for practicing division. It should be the same layout as the multiplication but using division
	instead. Don't worry about remainders, we only want whole numbers (e.g. 38 / 9 = 4).
-	research the modulus operator and then create another game for calculating the remainder one number 
	divided by another.
-	check the user input and display an error and retry if the user does not enter a number
- 	write a Random Number Guessing game. The number is between 0 and 100. If the user guesses within
	10 of the number, alert them that they are "Hot". If they are more than 10 but <= 20 of the number, 
	they are "Warm" and anything more than 20, they are cold. It should record and alert the number of
	guesses it takes for the user.
-	add features to the multiplication game:
		1. Allow the user to play mulitply times. This will require an extra while loop around the
			existing one. You will have to gather the confirmation from the 
		Ask the user how many questions he/she would like and then ask that many questions.
		2. After each round, ask the user if they would like to play again or quit.
		3. If they play mulitple rounds, make note of the highest score and update it each 
		time the record is broken, telling them their highest scroe when they eventually do quit.
-	(advanced) write a program for calculating mortgage repayments. Prompt the user for the loan amount, the 
	interest rate and the term. Once collected, calculate the monthly repayment and display it to the
	user. (provide the formulas).
